            <p>Hello and welcome to my webpage. As you can see the banananas have taken over the background and are way more interesting than anything I have to say about myself, but here we go...

            <p>Whats up everyone? Im nate and this is my very fancy amazing webpage that is going to just blow you away... well maybe not, but I have only been doing this for like 3 weeks sooo... any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated. I love the course so far, but would love to find a study group if anyone else lives around the glen mills, delco area!
